/* An event loop listens for events from multiple event sources. When
   an event arrives, it is queued and processed by calling the
   appropriate event handler. The event loop then continues to listen
   for more events. An event loop completes when there are no event
   sources to listen on.  External event sources can be plugged into
   the loop.

   There are 3 main components: 
   - a list of file descriptors to be monitored, GDB_NOTIFIER.  
   - a list of events that have occurred, EVENT_QUEUE.  
   - a list of signal handling functions, SIGHANDLER_LIST.

   GDB_NOTIFIER keeps track of the event sources. Event sources for
   gdb are currently the UI and the target.  Gdb communicates with the
   command line user interface via the readline library and usually
   communicates with remote targets via a serial port. Serial ports
   are represented in GDB as file descriptors and select/poll calls.
   For native targets instead, the communication consists of calls to
   ptrace and waits (via signals) or calls to poll/select (via file
   descriptors). In the current gdb, the code handling events related
   to the target resides in the wait_for_inferior function and in
   various target specific files (*-tdep.c).

   EVENT_QUEUE keeps track of the events that have happened during the
   last iteration of the event loop, and need to be processed.  An
   event is represented by a procedure to be invoked in order to
   process the event.  The queue is scanned head to tail.  If the
   event of interest is a change of state in a file descriptor, then a
   call to poll or select will be made to detect it.

   If the events generate signals, they are also queued by special
   functions that are invoked through traditional signal handlers.
   The actions to be taken is response to such events will be executed
   when the SIGHANDLER_LIST is scanned, the next time through the
   infinite loop.  

   Corollary tasks are the creation and deletion of event sources. */

   be called.  We have 2 queues, one for file handlers that we listen
   to in the event loop, and one for the file handlers+events that are
   ready. The procedure PROC associated with each event is always the

/* Stack for prompts. Each prompt is composed as a prefix, a prompt
   and a suffix. The prompt to be displayed at any given time is the
   one on top of the stack.  A stack is necessary because of cases in
   which the execution of a gdb command requires further input from
   the user, like for instance 'commands' for breakpoints and
   'actions' for tracepoints. In these cases, the prompt is '>' and
   gdb should process input using the asynchronous readline interface
   and the event loop.  In order to achieve this, we need to save
   somewhere the state of GDB, i.e. that it is processing user input
   as part of a command and not as part of the top level command loop.
   The prompt stack represents part of the saved state. Another part
   would be the function that readline would invoke after a whole line
   of input has ben entered. This second piece would be something
   like, for instance, where to return within the code for the actions
   commands after a line has been read.  This latter portion has not
   beeen implemented yet.  The need for a 3-part prompt arises from
   the annotation level. When this is set to 2, the prompt is actually
   composed of a prefix, the prompt itself and a suffix. */

/* At any particular time there will be always at least one prompt on
   the stack, the one being currently displayed by gdb. If gdb is
   using annotation level equal 2, there will be 2 prompts on the
   stack: the usual one, w/o prefix and suffix (at top - 1), and the
   'composite' one with prefix and suffix added (at top). At this
   time, this is the only use of the prompt stack. Resetting annotate
   to 0 or 1, pops the top of the stack, resetting its size to one
   element. The MAXPROMPTS limit is safe, for now. Once other cases
   are dealt with (like the different prompts used for 'commands' or
   'actions') this array implementation of the prompt stack may have
   to change. */
