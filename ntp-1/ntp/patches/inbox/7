Hello Harlan-

I take it that you're in charge of patches to xntp3 (?)...  I've been testing
xntpd3-5.92 for a few weeks now on a number of SCO OpenServer systems (on my
network at home, and at SCO actually -- I'm an engineer there, and I'm
working on updating the version of xntpd that we ship in our distribution).

I had two problems building/using xntpd on SCO OpenServer 5.0.*:

 - mkstemp() is missing from the target .so on SCO OpenServer 5.0.0, so
   avoiding it (for all SCO releases) is desireable.

 - mlockall() is just a stub under all SCO OpenServer releases to date.
   xntpd runs anyway, but yields a "mlockall not implemented" message
   in syslog.

I patched both functions out via configure.in (so mktemp() and plock() get
used instead), and it all builds and runs.  Again, that's with 5.92.

I just built 5.92d (again, with those two patches) about 30 minutes ago, and
it looks okay so far on my first test target (a Stratum-3 server pointed at
three Stratum-2's servers with one peer and one client).

Attached is a patch to configure.in (relative to 5.92d) for those two issues.



I've had mostly good results (with 5.92) on an NTP subnet of about 15
systems, but I have had two specific problems, on which I'd greatly value
your most wise advice...

Problem 1.  On two of my systems (so far), I've seen xntpd go into some sort
of infinite-spin situation (after running happily for hours or days).  When
this happens, 'ps' reports that it is constantly consuming cycles and netstat
reports that it is still listening at the NTP port, but xntpd doesn't respond
to any sort of communication (e.g. 'ntpq -p' just hangs until it times out;
clients of this server get no responses; 'ntpdate -d localhost' gets no
receive() packets).  When its in this state, even 'kill -9' won't kill xntpd.
This scenario occurs randomly with no warning in syslog, nor any interesting
behavior in loopstats.  It's happened several times over a period of three
weeks on one of my systems, and happened at least once on another system.
Have any similar problems been reported against 5.92?

Problem 2.  A colleague tried using my 5.92 build of xntpd as a broadcast
client -- it consistently dumps core.  xntpd -d says that the dump occurs
right after receiving the second incoming broadcast packet.  Here's the stack
trace from dbxtra, implicating ntp_peer.c+561.

	newpeer(srcadr = 0x4158a0, dstadr = 0x410640, hmode = 9, version = 3,
		minpoll = 6, maxpoll = 10, ttl = 0, key = 0),
		line 561 in "ntp_peer.c"
	receive(rbufp = 0x41589c), line 625 in "ntp_proto.c"
	main(argc = 1, argv = 0x7ffffb64, 0x7ffffb6c), line 817 in "ntpd.c"

I also located a news-posting from another 5.92 user who reported the same
behavior on his Solaris system, but his was a multicast client, whereas ours
is just regular broadcast.  Note that I haven't tried 5.92d as a broadcast
client yet, so forgive me if you fixed this one already.  :-}


Any hints would be most appreciated!

Thanks (and to all of you UDel folks) for xntpd.  :-}  Great stuff!
