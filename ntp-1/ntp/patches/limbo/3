Yes, that would work.  It would allow xntpd() to step the clock
forward quickly.  I suspect that operation would be much more common
than having to set the time back a significant amount.  Especially
since we try to run ntpdate at boot time to get the clock.

It would also be good not to log syslog messages on an EPERM error
message from settimeofday(), as I suspect this could happen often.

Thanks.

Jeff
