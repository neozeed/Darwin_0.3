Dave:

There was a compile error in refclock_palisade.c.  While I was at it I
fixed the warning about unsigned char != char as well.  Here's the diff:

# diff refclock_palisade.c refclock_palisade.c.orig
153c153
<       unsigned char   rpt_buf[LENCODE+1]; /* assembly buffer */
---
>       char            rpt_buf[LENCODE+1]; /* assembly buffer */
363c363,364
<                   printf("palisade_receive: unit %d: invalid packet
id:%2x%2x\n", 
---
>                   printf("palisade_receive: unit %d: invalid packet
> id:%2x%2x\n",
