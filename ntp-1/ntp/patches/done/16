Hello,

I'm not using GNU make.

I'm running make from the same directory as configure is located.
For instance, to be clear, unpacking xntp3-5.92.tar (using tar xvf)
creates a=20
directory xntp3-5.92 in which configure is directly located. In this
directory
I do the command ./configure

I guess it doesn't matter where the directory xntp3-5.92 is located?

The TIOCMBS is defined in sys/ioctl.h, that is in=20
/usr/sys/include/sys/ioctl.h

termios.h is located in the same directory.

The operating system is Digital Unix v4.0B

Regards,
Kenneth Jaldehag
