Hi Harlan,

I have tried ntp-4.0.70a on my FreeBSD box and when it startup, a
message is written to the console:
... ntpd[23211]: plock() error: No such file or directory

Then it coninues to run. A little looking into this seems that there
was a cut-and-paste glitch or something like that. There is three
lines that I think don't belong in ntpd.c, or maybe they belong
somewhere elese. In any case here is a diff for that.

A question, is local reference clocks suppose to work? On my machine
with a GPS attached I just get a signal 8 and coredump, but I haven't
started to investigate yet. On the other one with no local clocks it
has been running fine for more than a day though.

John
